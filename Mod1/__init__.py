Code created by Allison Valdez and AlgoExpert. This file is used to help
expose what functions, classes, etc are available to other scripts when the
module is imported. This python script will run EVERY TIME the module is
imported and can contain any code desired. Here we're very simply making it
easier for other scripts to access the process_files function. Note: other
scripts and functions are still accessible.
